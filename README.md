My current vimrc is on my Mac, and i don't have much time to reorganize and write a beautiful document to tell you how to install it.

Soooo, just wait, i think this or next month i will push my latest vimrc to here.

Hope you will like this guy's vimrc: [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)

spf13-vim is a distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, Gvim and MacVim.It is a good starting point for anyone intending to use VIM for development running equally well on Windows, Linux, *nix and Mac.
